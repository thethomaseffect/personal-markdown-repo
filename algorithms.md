Algorithms Exam TODO and Revision:
==================================

# To Do List

* Learn Tower of Hanoi and apply for n=5. State the algorithm in plain english. Prove there's no shorter algorithm. Find out how long it'd take for n=60.
* State and prove Warshall's algorithm for establishing the reachability matrix R of a boolean adjacency matrix M and apply it to matrix
*  State and prove Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path between two nodes in a positively weighted digraph.Is the assumption of positive weighting necessary and if so why? Apply it to the following graph to find the shortest distance and route from node f to node c.
*  Prove that, for any sorting algorithm applied to a list of length n, the worst case complexity is
proportional to nlog2n.
* Show worse case complexity for recursive algorithm in 5 (a).
* State conditions for valid recursive function definition. State why recursive function for weighted graph is valid and what it does. Evaluate the function for given letters.
* State why the function definition is valid for 4 (d) and what it does. Evaluate it a few times. Change it and say what would happen.
